    <title>What is 67?</title>
    <h1>The 67 meme</h1>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>One of the first major meme-usages was a video by TikToker @matvii_grinblat, in which the commentary mentions a basketball player as being “6’7” (i.e. six feet seven inches tall), and then plays the “Doot Doot (6 7)” song over video edits of LaMelo Ball (who is 6′7″). That video helped propel the meme. 
Know Your Meme. From there it spread: users began saying “six-seven” or “67” in various contexts (edits, jokes, etc.), often whenever numbers “6” and “7” appeared or could be used. It took off with Gen Z / Gen Alpha.

<p>“The 67 Kid” (often styled “6-7 Kid”) is a figure from recent internet meme culture — a young boy who went viral after shouting “six-seven” at an AAU basketball game, 
    which caught on via social media platforms like TikTok and Reels. The phrase comes from the song “Doot Doot (6 7)” by Skrilla, and the meme evolved to include slang, edits, and even analog horror-style content parodying SCP lore (not to be confused with the real SCP-067, which is something entirely different). 
 The virality of “6-7 Kid” reflects how simple, catchy moments can spread rapidly online and become part of Gen Z/Alpha pop culture.</p>
